# FoodTruck1
This project was developed and runs on Android Studio. It is an Ice Cream Truck where customers can create and customize their own ice cream orders. 
They can also pay for their orders as well. 
There are employee functions as well that allow them to add, delete, and edit both the specific ingredients and ice creams themselves.
